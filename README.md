### 📌 about
**Supply** is a highly configurable client-side utility designed to keep your workflow uninterrupted. Whether you are building, farming, or fighting, this mod automatically supplies your hand the moment you run out.

### 🛠️ what makes it special
- **intelligent caching:** Tracks what was in your hand before it ran out, allowing the mod to make smart decisions about what to supply next.
- **dual hand support:** Fully supports supplying items to both the Main Hand and Offhand.
- **seamless swapping:** If the item is in the hotbar, it changes your selection; if it's in the inventory, it moves it to your hand.
- **loyalty awareness:** Detects when you throw a weapon with the Loyalty enchantment and waits for it to return, rather than instantly filling the slot with a different item.
- **throwable control:** Prevents auto-supplying when throwing items like Eggs or Snowballs (tagged under `supply:throwables`) to stop accidental spam, while still allowing it if you drop the stack manually.
- **smart eating:** If you consume your last food item, the mod will only search for more food if you are still hungry.
- **copy search:** Always searches for an identical match first, strictly checking for matching Enchantments, Durability, and Data Components.
- **audio feedback:** Plays a subtle sound when a supply is successful, so you know you're locked and loaded.
- **continuous building:** Optionally supplies any available block item when your current stack runs out, allowing you to keep placing blocks without interruption.
- **in-game configuration:** Almost every behavior can be toggled via the config screen to fit your specific playstyle.
